# Hide-n-Seek
Hide and Seek Game for Bluetooth and iOS

This is a game where one or more players hide Bluetooth beacons and another player uses the app to find them. The light flashes red then orange then red as the seeker gets closer until finally victory is achieved. Meant to blend technology with real life going outdoors fun.

To preview, open the project in Xcode and run. Due to the use of a location dependent framework, it is recommended to run this on a mobile device with location services enabled.
